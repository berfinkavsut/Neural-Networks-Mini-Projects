# EEE 443 Neural Networks

* These mini-project assignments were solved for the EEE 443 Neural Network course at Bilkent University during Fall Semester 2020.
* The assignments were implemented in MATLAB. 

## Assignment #1 
- Neural network with one single hidden layer was implemented for XOR problem.
- Single layer perceptron was coded from scratch for image classification task.
- Two layer neural network was studied from a sample code in Jupyter notebook. 

## Assignment #2 
- Stochastic gradient descent on mini-batches is coded from scratch for cat vs. dog classification task. The neural network has two layers. Gradient descent with momentum was added to improve learning process. Test & training squared errors and classification errros were plotted. 
- Neural network with embedding matrix was implemented for one of the natural language processing (NLP) problems from scratch. Embedding matrix was used to map single word to a vector representation. Softmax activation function in output layer and cross-entropy loss function was used. 
- Fully connected networks and dropout concept was studies from an exercise in Jupyter notebook. 

## Assignment #3 
- Autoencoder with a single hidden layer is implemented for image data from scratch. Tykhonov regularization (L2 norm regularization) is included to enforce minimization of weight norms. Kullback-Leibler divergence is included to enforce sparsity.
- CNNs and Pytorch framework were studied from the sample codes in Jupyter notebook. 
- Recurrent neural networks (RNN) were implemented for a time-series sensor signals data from scratch. Weight initialization with Xavier Uniform distribution was used.
